#### Description:
    
    Thanks to Google Books Api, the application allows you to search for books that interest you.
    The application also allows you to manage your book collections.
    The application provides user service, including the registration and login system.
    There were 4 basic features (views) planned fo this app:
    1.  - Setting and viewing reading goals (yearly, monthly goals)
        - Viewing few currently reading books
    2.  - Viewing and editing all book collections
    3.  - Searching for the books of interest using google books api service
        - Viewing the searching results
    4.  - Viewing book reccomendations based on favourites and already read books

    I managed to accomplish simplier version of app:
    1.  - Setting and viewing years reading goals
    2.  - Viewing and editing all book collections
    3.  - Searching for the books of interest using google books api service
        - Viewing the searching results
